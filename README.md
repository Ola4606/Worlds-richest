World's Richest was my first React project, and it was built using React and TailwindCSS. It consumes live data from this API:

[API Link](https://forbes400.herokuapp.com/api/forbes400/real-time)

which provides data on the world's richest individuals in real-time. Although, this website only shows data on the top 100 richest people.

It allows users to view the following data on the world's top 100 richest people: Rank, Full Name, Net worth _(in US dollars)_, Source of wealth, Residence, and Bio _(a brief background)_.

As I said earlier, this was my first React project, but I did not want to create the same old e-commerce website or weather website that most Junior React developers were making, so I created this.

While creating this website I wanted to incorporate the data available on the Forbes website into an easy-to-use and simple website, so people could get the data they needed straight out of the website without all the other distractions.

Using TailwindCSS breakpoints, I was able to make it fully responsive for mobile, tablet, and laptop screens.

While building this website, I was able to improve my skills on some React principles and concepts, such as:

*   Using React Hooks _(namely useState, and useEffect)_
*   Using React Memo
*   Passing and receiving props
*   Using SVGs in React, etc.

I also learned new principles, which included the use of the Axios NPM package for making HTTP requests; and using Asynchronous functions.
